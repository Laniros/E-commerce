    What was hard to do?<br/>
    For me the designing was a little bit challenging because the whole project &ldquo;depends&rdquo; on it, later It
    was really hard to understand the react (using all the components of react &ndash; therefore I let my partaner take
    more work on this section )</p>

<p>Who is your partner? name and id. What did you do? What did your partner do?</p>

<p>My partner is Roy Einhorn, 310056932, the project was built together on overall but each one I think pushed more on the
    staff he is stronger so I built mostly the backend and the structure and Or built the front interface using the back
    that we have built together.</p>

<p>How did you make your store secured?</p>

<p>1. Each user can do his operations on his user only &ndash; required signUp and signIn for each user</p>

<p>2. The passwords is encrypted and not presented or saved anywhere- just the encrypted- no way do get it from the DB
    or the request.</p>

<p>3. We used express-rate-limit on order to prevent DDOS attacks.</p>

<p>
    Did you implement the store using react.js?<br/>
    Yes<br/>
